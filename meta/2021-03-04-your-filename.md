**Trend description:** There was an overall decrease in the UK pollinators index from 1987 onwards. In 2016, the index had declined by 31% compared to its value in 1980. This overall decline masks the trends of the individual species within the index, 44% of which have become less widespread, 14% of which have become more widespread and 42% of which have remained the same since the index began in 1980. The shaded area represents the 90% credible interval for the unsmoothed index
