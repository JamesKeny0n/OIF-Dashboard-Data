**Trend description:** After a period of sustained increase from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s the overall volume of outputs has remained relatively stable, with some variation from year to year. Annual variations are generally driven by external factors, in particular weather, affecting growing and harvest and the variation in cropping driven by prices.
