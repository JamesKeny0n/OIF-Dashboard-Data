**Trend description:** In 2016, 14% of English river water bodies assessed under the WFD
were in good or high ecological status when measured using the ‘one out all out’
methodology highlighted in the ‘interim indicator’ section above and there is evidence of a
small decline in these figures since 2014. [Other data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment) e.g. the percentage of individual tests meeting good or high ecological status, or the average concentration of individual pollutants, show the prevalence of good water quality and reductions in the level of somevpollutants in recent decades.
