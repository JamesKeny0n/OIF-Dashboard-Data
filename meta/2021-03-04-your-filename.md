  Note: The ‘Main River’ and the ‘River tributary’ load data are combined to
  calculate the annual total loads for selected metals, total nitrogen and
  ortho-phosphate. These load data (kg per year) are calculated using chemical
  concentration data reported in the Environment Agency’s public register (Water
  Information Management System) and flow data reported in the Environment
  Agency’s core system of hydrometric and hydrological values (Water Information
  System by Kisters). The interim indicator reports loads relative to the 2008
  baseline (index = 100).

**Trend description:** Although riverine inputs of cadmium, copper, mercury, zinc and
particularly lead into English tidal waters have fluctuated considerably since 2008, they have all fallen. Cadmium has seen the greatest reductions (58%), followed by copper (56%), lead and mercury (54%) and zinc (19%). Riverine inputs of total nitrogen and orthophosphate have also fluctuated considerably since 2008; both have fallen by 19% and 51% respectively.
