  Note: Assessment period starts in the 1980s or 1990s and ends in 2015 or 2016
  depending on the survey. For the Typical Length maps: • Long term increase: an
  increase in the size of fish within the community over the period • No
  long-term change: no change in the size of fish • Long term decrease: the size
  of fish in the community has decreased from an earlier period but has
  increased from a more recent period. • Decrease to minimum observed state: the
  fish in the community are currently at the lowest size recorded. For the Mean
  Maximum Length maps: • Long term increase: the fish are shifting back towards
  larger species • No long-term change: no change in the composition of fish
  communities • Long term decrease: more smaller species than in an earlier
  period but less than in a more recent one. • Decrease to minimum observed
  state: the community has the highest proportion of small species recorded.

**Trend description:** In the Channel, northern North Sea and the eastern Irish Sea, the
health of the demersal fish community has improved since the 1990s, with an increasing
contribution of species that attain a large size (Typical Length).

In the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the
balance of species within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted
towards smaller bodied fish (low Typical length) and smaller species (low Mean Maximum
Length), and so these communities are in poorer health. There has been no long-term
change in Mean Maximum Length of demersal fish communities in the northern North Sea.

In contrast, no change in the Typical Length in the pelagic fish community is evident.
Within the southern and central North Sea, the Mean Maximum Length of pelagic fish
communities is declining suggesting the proportion of large or slow growing species is
declining. There is no long-term change in the Mean Maximum Length in the northern
North Sea.

While fishing is the most likely driver of the declines in the pelagic and demersal
communities, it is unclear whether they are caused by exploitation only or whether there
are possible alternative causes. For example, global warming may have caused an influx
of smaller species or smaller fish.
