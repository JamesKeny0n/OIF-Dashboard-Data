  Note: Inshore data, predominantly collected under the WFD between 2010 and
  2015, were used to assess seagrass, rocky shore macroalgae and saltmarsh
  habitats. Soft sediment invertebrates were assessed using inshore
  (predominantly WFD) and offshore (non-WFD) intertidal and subtidal data
  collected between 2010 and 2015

**Trend description:** The UK Marine Strategy target for intertidal seagrass communities
were met for all Regional Seas. Four Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an
absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing
WFD classification data. The natural conditions required for seagrass beds to exist limits
their occurrence in coastal water bodies. However for those contributing, the quality
threshold of ‘Good’ or ‘High’ Ecological Status was met for the majority of surveyed
locations. The Irish Sea had the lowest extent of intertidal seagrass meeting the quality
target, although the total remains markedly above the indicator quantity threshold of 85%.

The UK Marine Strategy target for the intertidal rocky shore macroalgae was met for all
seven assessed Regional Seas. Two Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an
absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing
WFD classification data.

The UK Marine Strategy target for the saltmarsh communities was largely met for the
Celtic Seas and Northern North Sea but was not met for considerable areas of the
Southern North Sea and the Eastern English Channel Regional Seas. Five Regional Seas
were not assessed due to either an absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the
indicator or an absence of existing WFD classification data.

The UK Marine Strategy target for soft sediment (benthic) invertebrate communities was
largely met for most Regional Seas including the Minches and Western Scotland, Scottish
Continental Shelf, Shared Waters between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland,
Northern North Sea and Eastern English Channel. The Western Channel and Celtic Sea
did not reach the target largely due to the inshore WFD classification results, while the
failure of the Southern North Sea to meet the target can be attributed to the offshore
results. The Irish Sea did not meet the target due to both inshore and offshore results. The
Atlantic North-West Approaches was not assessed due to an absence of data.
