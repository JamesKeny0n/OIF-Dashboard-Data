**Short description:** This indicator will show changes in the distribution of non-native invasive species and plant pests that have already established in England. Preventing the spread of invasive non-native species limits their ability to disrupt ecosystems and cause economic damage. Plant pests and diseases cause significant negative impacts and it is often more difficult to prevent their entry and establishment, therefore limiting spread is critical in preventing negative impact on native species and ecosystems. This indicator will utilise distribution data for a reference subset of priority invasive species and plant pests and diseases as an indication of the success of biosecurity measures in controlling their spread.

**Trend description:** The number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established in England within a rolling 10-year period fell from a peak of 7 in the 10-year period 2000-09 to a low of 3 in 2007-16. However, it has recently increased again to 5 in 2009-18 (the most recent 10-year period for which data are available). In all, 11 pests and diseases became established in England in the 19 years from 2000 to 2018 and of these, five tree pests and diseases became ‘established’ between 2009 and 2018, namely: 
1. Alder Rust (Melampsoridium hiratsukanum), considered established in 2009; 
2. Chalara dieback of Ash (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus), considered established in 2012; 
3. Oriental chestnut gall wasp, considered established in 2016;
4. Sweet chestnut blight caused by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, considered established in 2017; and
5. The Elm zigzag sawfly (Aproceros leucopoda), considered established in 2018, following a rapid expansion across Europe from eastern Asia.
