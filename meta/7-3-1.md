indicator_name: Enhancement of green/blue infrastructure
national_geographical_coverage: England
---
**Short description:** This indicator will show changes in the quantity, quality, accessibility and functioning of green and blue infrastructure. Green and blue spaces in and around our built environment, including within Green Belts, are essential to health and happiness. This indicator will be developed from work on a new framework of standards for green and blue infrastructure. These standards aim to ensure that new developments include accessible green space and that any area with little or no green space can be improved for the benefit of the community. Green and blue infrastructure can also make an important contribution towards adaptation to climate change. The indicator will use information gathered through implementation of the framework of standards and by Natural England using a new people and nature survey that will collect data in 2019/20. This will build on the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) and incorporate feedback from stakeholders as part of a strategic review.
