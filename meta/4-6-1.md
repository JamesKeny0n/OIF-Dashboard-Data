**Trend description:** By 2016, the index of relative abundance of priority species in the UK had declined to 40% of its value in 1970. In total, 63% of species included within the index decreased in abundance; 22% of species increased in abundance; and 16% showed no change. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval for the index. Between 1970 and 2016, the index of distribution of priority species in the UK declined by 27%. The majority of this decline occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s; since then, the index has remained relatively stable. Overall, 37% of species included within the index decreased in their distribution; 16% increased in their distribution; and 46% showed no change. The shaded area represents the 90% credible interval for the index.
