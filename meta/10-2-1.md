**Short description:** The poorest people and countries in the world are often the most vulnerable and likely to be hardest hit by the degradation of natural environments. Climate change and the deterioration of natural environments are prime drivers of poverty, food insecurity and instability, and can trigger conflict and migration. This indicator will report outcomes of UK investment programmes (such as International Climate Finance, the Darwin Initiative and the Illegal Wildlife Challenge Fund) that support developing countries to protect and improve the environment, address illegal wildlife trade, mitigate and adapt to climate change and alleviate poverty.
