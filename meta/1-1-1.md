**Trend description:** Emissions for all 5 key air pollutants in England have fallen over the latest 20 years for which annual, country-level data are available. Emissions of SO2 have seen the greatest reductions, falling by 90% between 1998 and 2018. Emissions of NMVOCs and NOx have fallen by 62% and 59% respectively, and emissions of PM2.5 and NH3 have fallen by 37% and 13% respectively over the same time period. More recently, the trends in annual emissions of PM2.5 and NMVOC have levelled off and emissions of NH3 have increased. For PM2.5, decreases in emissions from many sources have been partially offset by increases in emissions from residential burning (domestic combustion); emissions of PM2.5 from this source increased by 56% between 2007 and 2018.
