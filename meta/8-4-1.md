**Short description:** This indicator will track changes in the exposure and consider risk to wildlife from chemicals in freshwater, marine, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Data are currently available for some chemicals and some invertebrates, fish, shellfish, crustaceans, mammals, and birds of prey. Data for exposure of other species groups to chemicals may become available in the future. Further work is needed to develop indicators of the adverse effects of chemicals on wildlife populations which may be included in future.
