  This indicator tracks the changes in greenhouse gas emissions from natural
  resources as described in the [Clean Growth
  Strategy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/700496/clean-growth-strategy-correction-april-2018.pdf).
  Greenhouse gases contribute to global climate change which is a pressure on
  many aspects of our environment. The indicator shows the annual net amount of
  greenhouse gas emissions from land use and land use change, the forestry,
  agriculture and waste sectors and from the use of fluorinated gases. Net
  emissions from peatland will be included when the Wetland Supplement is
  implemented in the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory

**Trend description:** After a small initial increase, emissions of greenhouse gases from natural resources in England have fallen by 52%, from 106 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e) in 1990 to 51 Mt CO2e in 2018. Net greenhouse gas emissions have fallen from all sectors included within this indicator, however the greatest reduction has been achieved in the waste sector (38 Mt CO2e or 69%). While emissions from land use and land use change, fluorinated gases and from agriculture have fallen by 52%, 31%, and 19% respectively, and net removals by the forestry sector have increased by 14%, the total net improvements in these 4 sectors combined (16 Mt CO2e) is less than half of that achieved in the waste sector.
