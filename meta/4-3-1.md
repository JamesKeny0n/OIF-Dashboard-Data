**Trend description:** The total area of woodland in England has increased from 1.24 million hectares in 1998 to 1.31 million hectares in 2019, equating to an increase from 9.5% to 10.0% of the land area of England. This growth has been driven by an increase in broadleaf woodland; the area of conifer woodland in England has remained relatively static over the last 20 years.
