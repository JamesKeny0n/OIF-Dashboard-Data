**Trend description:** The percentage of softwood growth in England which is harvested has fluctuated between 67% and 92% over the 9 years for which these data are reported, reflecting sustained active management of softwood resources. The percentage of hardwood growth which is harvested remains much lower (between 13% and 16% over the same 9-year period), reflecting a lower level of active management of broadleaved woodland for timber supplies.
