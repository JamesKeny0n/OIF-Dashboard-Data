**Short description:** This indicator will show changes in the health and wellbeing benefits that the natural environment provides for people. These will include benefits for mental and physical health that are gained from accessing nature, but also benefits such as improvements in air quality, climate regulation (e.g. urban cooling) and noise mitigation that people obtain whether they access nature or not. The indicator will track changes for people in disadvantaged groups and others who may benefit the most. Part of this indicator will be measured by Natural England using a new people and nature survey that will collect data in 2019/20. This will build on the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) and incorporate feedback from stakeholders as part of a strategic review. Further research on health and wellbeing benefits is in progress.
