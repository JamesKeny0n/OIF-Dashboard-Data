**Trend description:** Concentrations of roadside NO2 in England have fallen from 60 μg/m3 in 1997 to 30 μg/m3 in 2019, a drop of 49% over the latest 22 years for which data are available. Although the general trend in measured NO2 concentrations is decreasing and falls below the NO2 limit value of 40μg/m3 in recent years, there are hotspots of NO2 exceedances which are being addressed through the NO2 plans. 


**Notes:** The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval for the annual mean concentration measured at roadside sites. The interval narrows over time because of an increase in the number of monitoring sites and a reduction in the variation between annual means for NO2.
