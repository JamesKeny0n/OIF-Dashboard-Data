  Note: Trends in UK seafloor litter are represented by spatially smoothed
  predictions of the median total number of pieces of litter per kilometre, at a
  grid of points. The colours represent differing relative medians. This is
  using data combined over the years, although similar patterns are present in
  the data for the individual years. More data are required to make a full
  assessment of the trend in the amount of seafloor litter in specific areas of
  UK waters.

**Trend description:** The average total abundance of beach litter items per 100m of coast
varies considerably around the UK with greater quantities being recorded in the Celtic
Seas than the Greater North Sea. After showing some decrease from 2011 to 2013, beach
litter levels in the Celtic Seas whilst fluctuating have risen to greater than the 2008 levels.
In the Greater North Sea there has been an increase in beach litter levels. Water currents,
weather conditions, and prevailing wind conditions can have an influence on the deposition
and retention of beach litter and therefore beach litter abundance.
From 2004 to 2014 approximately 60% of surveyed fulmars were found to have more than
0.1g of plastic found in their stomachs. This reflects the abundance of floating litter in their environment.
From sampling UK seafloor litter to date higher amounts of litter and plastic have been
found per km2 of seafloor in the Greater North Sea compared to the Celtic Seas. There
were also higher amounts of seafloor litter in the southern parts of the Greater North Sea
and Celtic Seas, which could be a result of increasing human pressures.
