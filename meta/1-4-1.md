**Trend description:** The average daily maximum 8 hour mean concentration of ozone has fluctuated since the start of the time series in 1987. It was 72 μg/m3 in 2018; a 28% increase in concentration compared to 1987 but a slight decrease in concentration compared to 2018 (74 μg/m3). Some variance from year-to-year is expected due to fluctuations in the occurrence of hot summer weather conditions which are associated with high ozone concentrations.
