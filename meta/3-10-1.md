**Trend Description:** Overall, there is evidence of a positive trend towards a greater
proportion of stocks fished sustainably and within safe biological limits. The percentage of
fish stocks (including Nephrops) fished at or below levels capable of producing maximum
sustainable yield (FMSY) has increased from 7% in 1990 to 49% in 2017.The percentages
fished above FMSY and at unknown levels relative to FMSY have both decreased over the
same time period. In the most recent year of assessment (2017), there was a 6.7%
decrease in the percentage of stocks with fishing pressure below FMSY due to data
availability and consequently more stocks were classified as “unknown”.

To maintain the reproductive capacity of stocks, each stock’s spawning biomass (SSB)
should be at or above the level capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (i.e. MSY
Btrigger). The percentage of stocks subject to quota management and achieving this goal
has increased from 32% in 1990 to 60% in 2017.The percentages of stocks below MSY
Btrigger and the percentage of stocks with unknown SSB have both decreased between
1990 and 2017.
