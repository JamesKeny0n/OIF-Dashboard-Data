**Trend description:** The indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England have both declined between 1970 and 2018; the latter experiencing steeper declines during the late 70’s and early 80’s. The indicators for widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland in England have also declined between 1990 and 2018, the former more steeply than the latter. However, in recent years, both butterfly indicators have shown little change. The indicator for widespread bats on farmland in England has increased since the turn of the century. Whilst these overall trends are clear from the charts, they mask the trends for individual species within each index – some farmland and woodland species trends have increased whereas others have decreased over time. The charts show the unsmoothed (dashed lines) and smoothed (solid lines) trends for each of the species indices; the shaded areas represent the 95% confidence intervals for the smoothed trends; and the figure in brackets shows the number of species in the index.
