**Short description:** This indicator will focus on disruption to public water supply due to drought. Water companies have a statutory duty to produce a water resources management plan (WRMP) and drought plan. The WRMPs, prepared, published and maintained in accordance with provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991 and regulations and directions made under it, must set out how a company intends to maintain the balance between supply and demand for water over at least the next 25 years. This includes how it will manage the increasing pressures on our water supplies from a growing population and climate change, whilst protecting the environment. Water company drought plans, also prepared, published and maintained under Water Industry Act 1991, set out the operational actions the water companies will take before, during and after a drought to maintain a secure supply of water. This indicator will track changes in a Supply Demand Balance Index (SDBI), which will be reported by all water and sewerage companies from Summer 2022. The SDBI will be reported within annual reviews of the WRMPs and as part of the Environment Agencyâ€™s Environmental Performance Assessment (EPA) report.
