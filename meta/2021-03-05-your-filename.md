indicator_name: Overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities
---
**Short description:** This indicator will track the impact on the environment overseas resulting from our domestic consumption, linked to the sustainability of the products we import. We are exploring methods and data for this indicator that could include a measure of the environmental impact of some of the commodities we import (for example, on deforestation and/or water stress).
