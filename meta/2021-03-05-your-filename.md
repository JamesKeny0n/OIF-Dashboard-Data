**Short description:** This indicator shows changes in municipal waste recycling rates in England. The municipal waste recycling rate is the fraction of household waste and waste similar in nature and composition to household waste, which is recycled. The indicator reflects levels of everyday waste that is recycled and not sent for final disposal. Development of the waste tracking tool and further integration with data collected by local authorities will close some of the data gaps and will enable collection of more comprehensive data.

**Trend description:** In 2018/19, the recycling rate for ‘Waste from Households’ was 45.1%, up 3.2 percentage points on the equivalent figure for 2010/11 (when the measure was first reported). While the measure of ‘household waste’ recycling is based on a broader definition of waste and not directly comparable to ‘Waste from Households’, there has been a 33.9 percentage point increase in the waste recycling rate across the 2 measures between 2000/01 and 2018/19.
