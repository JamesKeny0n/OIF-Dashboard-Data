**Short description:** This indicator will track changes in peopleâ€™s attitudes and behaviours relating to the environment, covering different sectors of the population. It will track attitudes such as willingness to change lifestyle and behaviours in key policy areas relating to sustainable use of natural resources, such as waste, water and energy. It will be measured by Natural England using a new people and nature survey that will collect data in 2019/20. This will build on the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) and incorporate feedback from stakeholders as part of a strategic review.
