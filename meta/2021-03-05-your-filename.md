  Trend description: The number of illegal waste sites fell to 556 active
  illegal sites in England in 2013/14. Since then, the number has increased
  gradually, reaching 685 in 2018/19. Within this total, the number of high-risk
  active illegal waste sites fell by 27.8% from a peak of 353 sites in 2012/13
  to 255 sites in 2018/19. The number of incidents of flytipping in England fell
  from 1.28 million in 2007/08 to 715 thousand incidents in 2012/13. Despite
  initial reductions, between 2012/13 and 2018/19, the number of incidents

Short description: This indicator tracks changes in the main types and scale of waste crime. Waste crime is the illegal management of all forms of waste. If not handled properly, waste can cause serious pollution of the environment – air, land and water, which can be harmful to health. It further reduces the availability of resources from waste because waste isn’t captured through legitimate routes. Current data reported includes illegal waste sites and fly-tipping. These current data can be used to establish some aspects of waste types, level of criminal activity and geographic distribution. Options for further development will be considered, including the impacts and behavioural aspects of waste crime, the amount and types of potential resources lost through waste crime, and to reflect the need for targeting and effective enforcement to deliver reductions in the level of criminal activities.
