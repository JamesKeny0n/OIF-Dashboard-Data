**Short description:** This indicator tracks changes in consumer buying choices as they impact on carbon footprint by looking at the national consumption-based carbon footprint. The indicator will show how consumer preferences and behaviour are impacting on the overall national carbon footprint.

**Trend description:** Englandâ€™s carbon footprint was estimated to be 652.3 million tonnes CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2017, a 15.3% reduction on levels in 2001 (770.5 MtCO2e). Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted directly by households (making up 18.8% of the footprint in 2017) were 11.1% lower in 2017 than in 2001 as a result of reductions in emissions associated with household-related heating. Total consumption-based emissions have been on a downward trajectory since 2007: the greatest contribution to this trend has come from the goods and services produced in England and consumed here; and emissions embedded in imports have also reduced substantially (26.6% and 19.5% respectively from a 2007 peak). As a proportion of total emissions in 2017, GHGs emitted overseas in the production of goods and services consumed in England made up 46.3% of the total footprint.
