**Short description:** This indicator will track the extent of peopleâ€™s social action for the environment such as environmental volunteering, participation in conservation work and donations to environmental organisations. The indicator will assess how well people from all sectors of society are taking action to improve the environment. It will be measured by Natural England using a new people and nature survey that will collect data in 2019/20. This will build on the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) and incorporate feedback from stakeholders as part of a strategic review. Additional information will also be collected by voluntary bodies.

**Trend description:** Between 2000 and 2017, the index of the amount of time contributed by environmental volunteers in England has fluctuated and overall, it has increased by 40%.
