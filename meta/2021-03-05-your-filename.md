national_indicator_description: >-
  Trend description: Residual waste here refers to waste sent to landfill or
  incineration in England. In 2018, the total quantity of waste (excluding major
  mineral wastes) 6 landfilled or incinerated in England was 29.0 million
  tonnes, an 8.6% reduction against levels in 2010 (31.7 million tonnes). This
  reduction was due to less waste being landfilled (falling by almost half over
  the period), whereas waste sent to incineration more than doubled in the same
  period.

**Short description:** This indicator shows how much waste is incinerated and landfilled in England rather than recycled, reused or treated further up the waste hierarchy. Data are captured through returns made by facilities that are permitted, local authority data submitted and also via non-site based regulation activity. There are still gaps in the data and these will need to be addressed in order to provide reporting by type and sector.
