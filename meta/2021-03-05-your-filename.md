**Short description:** Biosecurity measures to prevent the establishment of invasive non-native species are a key element of protecting against their significant economic, environmental and social impacts. This indicator will show how the number of invasive non-native species entering Great Britain has been abated (i.e. reduced) by comparing a predicted trend for establishment of invasive non-native species against actual establishment. Establishment of invasive species depends on factors such as trade and climate change. The difference to the trend in actual establishment then provides a measure of the success of biosecurity measures. The indicator will draw on data from the Non-Native Species Information Portal, overseen by the GB NonNative Species Secretariat, which maintains an early detection, surveillance and monitoring mechanism that facilitates management, including rapid response. This indicator requires significant development, including deciding on which species to include and establishing a baseline for the predicted and established trend.

**Trend description:** Between the periods 1960-69 and 2010-18, the number of invasive non-native species established in or along 10% or more of Great Britainâ€™s land area or coastline has increased in the freshwater, terrestrial and marine (coastal) environments, with the greatest increases having been observed in the marine and terrestrial environments.
