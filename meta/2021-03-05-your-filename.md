**Short description:** This indicator will track changes in people’s engagement with the natural environment. Spending time in the natural environment improves our health and wellbeing. This indicator will measure time spent in natural spaces (woodland, parks, coasts and freshwaters, alongside other natural places), people’s levels of care and concern, and other ways in which people enjoy and relate to the environment. It will be measured by Natural England using a new people and nature survey that will collect data in 2019/20. This will build on the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) and incorporate feedback from stakeholders as part of a strategic review.

**Trend description:** There has been an increase in the proportion of adults visiting the natural environment at least once a week, from 54% in 2009/10 to 65% in 2018/19. In 2018/19, 16% of adults visited the natural environment every day or more than once per day.
