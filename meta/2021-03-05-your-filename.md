**Short description:** This indicator will track changes in the exposure of people to noise from transportation sources. It does not include neighbour and neighbourhood noise. The indicator will show the estimated number of people exposed to noise levels (in 5 decibel bands) from the most significant road, rail and air sources. Health costs (and hence burden to the economy) of noise can be estimated from health outcomes associated with noise exposure (such as annoyance, sleep disturbance, and cardiovascular effects). The data used for this indicator are currently derived through strategic noise mapping undertaken at 5-year intervals.
