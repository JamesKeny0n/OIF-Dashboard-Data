**Short description:** This indicator will track changes in the impacts of flooding and coastal erosion on people’s lives. It will cover impacts on homes, businesses, communities, infrastructure, economy and people’s health. This indicator will show impact of natural hazards on people and the benefits to society provided by the reduction in unwanted impacts, including through management of natural capital assets that help to regulate flooding and coastal erosion. The indicator will be sensitive to future climate change and effectiveness of adaptation. Scope and details of the indicator are subject to decisions on long-term Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management (FCERM) policy. Later this year, the government will set out its policies to tackle flood and coastal erosion risk in the long term, and the Environment Agency will publish the updated Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England.
