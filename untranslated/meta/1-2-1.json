Net greenhouse gas emissions have fallen from all sectors included within this indicator, however the greatest reduction has been achieved in the waste sector (38 Mt CO2e or 69%). While emissions from land use and land use change, fluorinated gases and from agriculture have fallen by 52%, 31%, and 19% respectively, and net removals by the forestry sector have increased by 14%, the total net improvements in these 4 sectors combined (16 Mt CO2e) is less than half of that achieved in the waste sector.","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/6981fea20448a1755d5b1903c5e10207a9f047da","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-02-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/8164da56ccf1d5ffe562444acb7dfe46ce64f6cf","indicator":"1.2.1","target_id":"1.2","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"indicator_sort_order":"01-02-01","graph_title":"Emissions of greenhouse gases from natural resources in England by sector, 1990 to 2018"}
