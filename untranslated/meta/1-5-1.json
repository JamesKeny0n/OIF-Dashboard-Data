Although the general trend in measured NO2 concentrations is decreasing and falls below the NO2 limit value of 40\u03bcg/m3 in recent years, there are hotspots of NO2 exceedances which are being addressed through the NO2 plans. \n\n\n**Notes:** The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval for the annual mean concentration measured at roadside sites. The interval narrows over time because of an increase in the number of monitoring sites and a reduction in the variation between annual means for NO2.","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/a3e4d1cceaaf16583d40b39480e41197446c60cc","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-02-26: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/e44635c845b4b535bdd4bf2988322bb8655a46ee","indicator":"1.5.1","target_id":"1.5","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"01-05-01","graph_title":"Roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in England, 1997 to 2019"}
