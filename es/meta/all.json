Emissions of SO2 have seen the greatest reductions, falling by 90% between 1998 and 2018. Emissions of NMVOCs and NOx have fallen by 62% and 59% respectively, and emissions of PM2.5 and NH3 have fallen by 37% and 13% respectively over the same time period. More recently, the trends in annual emissions of PM2.5 and NMVOC have levelled off and emissions of NH3 have increased. For PM2.5, decreases in emissions from many sources have been partially offset by increases in emissions from residential burning (domestic combustion); emissions of PM2.5 from this source increased by 56% between 2007 and 2018.","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/e3ff2201015e13c3ce68ce77519d4950fd094382","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-02-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/70daedd38ccfb7faa45446a139ddc54240be9f03","indicator":"1.1.1","target_id":"1.1","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"01-01-01","graph_title":"Emissions for five key air pollutants in England, 1998 to 2018"},"1-3-1":{"indicator_name":"Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in England, 2011 to 2018","indicator_number":"A3","computation_units":"Population-weighted annual mean concentrations (ug/m3)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Defra","source_url_1":"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data","reporting_status":"complete","page_content":"**Trend description**: Population-weighted annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 in England have declined from 12.1 ug/m3 in 2011 to 9.6 ug/m3 in 2019, a fall of 21% over the latest 8 years for which data are available.","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/e062581ddefd68272a217ca00b58c8bd23e3affd","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-02-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/f9bcdf80c438ad4a508478d924201bad674b9941","indicator":"1.3.1","target_id":"1.3","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"01-03-01","graph_title":"Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in England, 2011 to 2018"}}
