It was 72 \u03bcg/m3 in 2018; a 28% increase in concentration compared to 1987 but a slight decrease in concentration compared to 2018 (74 \u03bcg/m3). Some variance from year-to-year is expected due to fluctuations in the occurrence of hot summer weather conditions which are associated with high ozone concentrations.","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/ee1345c6d562820cd1162366f4eab69f5ad48322","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-02-25: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard-Data/commit/15c61b4ad9aada5d65537a82a018f4d688e508cb","indicator":"1.4.1","target_id":"1.4","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"01-04-01","graph_title":"Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3) in England, 1987 to 2019"}
